# How to Use Bar Bending Schedule Program in Microsoft Excel for Free
 
If you are a civil engineer or a contractor who needs to prepare a bar bending schedule (BBS) for reinforcement steel, you might be looking for a software that can simplify and speed up the process. A BBS is a list of reinforcement steel bars that includes the size, number, shape, cutting length, weight and bending details of each bar. It is used to communicate the design requirement of reinforcement steel to the fabricator and execution team and to calculate the total weight and cost of steel.
 
One of the most popular and easy-to-use software for preparing BBS is Microsoft Excel. Excel is a spreadsheet program that allows you to enter data, perform calculations, create charts and graphs, and format your document. You can also use Excel templates that are pre-designed spreadsheets with formulas and formatting for specific purposes. One such template is the Bar Bending Schedule Program in Microsoft Excel, which is available for free download from various sources online.
